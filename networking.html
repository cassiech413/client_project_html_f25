            <h2>Introduction of Making Connections With People</h2>
            <p>
                Building a professional network is more than asking for jobs—it's about creating authentic relationships, learning from others, and discovering opportunities you might not find online. Start small: talk to classmates, join student organizations, and attend events. These small steps can open doors to meaningful long-term connections.

        <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Find Alumni:</strong> 
            Use UMSI resources such as the LinkedIn Group, Alumni Tool, CareerLink, UCAN, or attend networking/recruiting events. Don't forget your own network—friends, peers, faculty, mentors, or LinkedIn searches. 
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Get a Response:</strong> 
            Don't get discouraged by low response rates—20% is normal. Aim to move the conversation forward through a phone call, video chat, coffee meeting, or email exchange.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Do:</strong> 
                    Keep it short, set a clear time frame (e.g., 20 minutes), personalize your message.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don't:</strong>
                    Ask for info you can Google, send your resume right away, or immediately request a job/referral.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>Do I need to network if I'm not looking for a job right now?</strong><br>
        Yes! Networking is about building long-term relationships. Starting early makes it easier to reach out when you do need advice or opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>What if I feel shy or don't know what to say?</strong><br>
        You don't need to have all the answers—just be curious. Ask people about their career path, challenges, and advice. Most professionals enjoy sharing their story.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>How many informational interviews should I aim for?</strong><br>
        There's no magic number, but a good goal is 2-3 per month. Focus on quality conversations rather than quantity.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Is it okay to reach out to someone I don't know on LinkedIn?</strong><br>
        Yes, as long as your message is polite, personalized, and concise. Mention something specific you admire about their work to increase your chances of getting a response.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>What should I do after a networking conversation?</strong><br>
        Always send a thank-you note or email within 24 hours. Stay in touch by updating them on your progress or sharing resources they might find useful.
